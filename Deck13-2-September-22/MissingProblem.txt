Problem - 

Given a matrix. There are bombs placed at some cells denoted by value -1. So, 
wherever a bomb is placed, the cells around it explodes which means there value 
gets incremented by 1 except if that is a bomb too. Initial value of all empty cells is 
assumed to be 0. So, print the final state of the matrix after all bombs explode.
